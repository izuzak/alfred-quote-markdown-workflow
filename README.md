# Alfred Workflow: Quote Markdown text from Clipboard

This is an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) [workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) for quoting Markdown content from clipboard.
When triggered, the workflow pastes clipboard contents while prefixing every line with the `>` character, which quotes the line in Markdown.

## Installation 💾

1. Download the `alfred-quote-markdown-workflow.alfredworkflow` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/izuzak/alfred-quote-markdown-workflow/releases/latest) to your machine.
2. Double-click on the `alfred-quote-markdown-workflow.alfredworkflow` file and accept the installation of the workflow into Alfred.

## Usage 🚜

1. Copy some text to the clipboard.
2. Trigger the workflow with `CTRL+SHIFT+M`. The text you previously copied to the clipboard should now be pasted into the active application with every line prefixed with the `>` character. Also, the latest item in the clipboard will now be the Markdown-quoted text.

## Configuration 🔧

You can change the hotkey for triggering the workflow in Alfred's Preferences, in the Workflows tab. Click on the "Paste as quoted Markdown" in the list, and then double-click on the "Hotkey" item in the workflow editor shown in the right pane.
